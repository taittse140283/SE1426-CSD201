This is some notes for project and some important for project
-Problem 1:

+ First day, I really don't understand about project. However, after a few days, I got a little better. 
+ I searched the internet, in the book. Fortunately, a portion of them is already in the book (as DoublyLinkedList), but there are many parts I still don't understand. I say here is the CLI
+I used DoublyLinkedList, Priority to solve the problem. However,      I still do not understand CLI. Therefore, I could not finish it.
+ After seeing the teacher test, I understood CLI better. I try to finish the project


-Problem 2:
+ Fortunately, I finished it
+ I think problem 2 so difficult.However, I am wrong
+ To solve the problem 2, I used to little knowledge from java java desktop application (as read HTML from web). It is really helpful
+Beside in, I searched in the book to solve problem 2.
+Summary:  +Problem 1:
			. I am still CLI, I don't understand.
			. I did it
	      + Problem 2, I finished.
-For me, this is a very different lab article than the lab I have ever done. I already know how to use git that I never knew(as commit, push, checkout,...). I already understand the function of cmd, build 1 file from netbeans to file .jar.

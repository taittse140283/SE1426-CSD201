    > _Hi teacher, I'm glad to learn with you in CSD201. You're a professional Dev and have too much experiences. Truely, I must say I'm belong to a kind of people that I'm to slow to understand something. After 5 weeks I had learned with you, maybe I could know a little about how to use GitHub, how to do and work like a pro coder, etc.... I'm so happy about all of that.
    > Maybe can say this is the first time I have done a project like this, it's difficult to me and I think this's my fault, I'm not good enough about code. Actually, my project wasn't completely finish. I just done Lab1_2, it was run but not perfect like you want.
    > I will try to finish it in the future.
    
    **About Lab1_2:**
    1. Firstly, I use Hashmap to save the name's tag and how many time a tag appeared.
    2. Secondly, luckily that I learned how to take an URL of a web in Lab Java Desktop 1 week ago so I can solve this problem easy.
    3. Thirdly, I have a mistake that I give it show all tag of a URL :)) so when run will need some second to finish. But it still ok, I can create a file csv to save all tag appeared.
    
    Finally, I hope I can do better in the future, I'll try my best.

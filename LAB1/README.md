### Some note for project (LAB1):
 -First, when I heard about the topic of the project, I think it very hard for me because because I don't know much about linkedlist and don't know where i should start.
 -So lucky, when I didn't know what to do, some of my friends helped me find a solution. and I knew where to start.
 - And finally I completed it ^^.

### Some problems when doing the project :
LAB1_1:
 - Teacher suggest class use DoublyLinkedList and PriorityQueue to do. And I find out the ways to use them effectively.
 - The first problem I encountered was in the class add() and after consulting in many places, I also solved my problem.
 - After that class detele I think this part is quite easy and most people know how to solve it .The next problem I encountered was that lass update at the beginning everything went smoothly until I updated the first and last player,and then I have found a way to solve them . I think this is the part where I solved it best in lab1_1.
 
LAB1_2:
- When I first started I knew where to start but it wasn't as easy as I thought and I think most people find LAB1_2 more difficult than LAB1_1
- It took me 2 days to find a solution when I was stuck in comparing tag .

Problem about CLI:

- Because this is the first time, I still do not know how to do CLI so I consulted from my classmates in part because it is almost time for me to try to complete this part in the next LAB. ^^

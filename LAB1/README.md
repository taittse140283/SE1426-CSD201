- Hello teacher, I am really happy with your exercises :)). I think I could improve a little bit my skills through it. You know, The first time, you came my class, you talked a lot of thing, but I couldn't understand them. For example, CLI or build file java to file jar :)). Yes really, I felt maybe I couldn't overcome this course. :)). I also learnt and enjoyed Information technology nearly when I go to university. All previous time, I don't know more about technologies. So, I really hope, I can learn more things from you(help me).
-Through your exercise, I had some problems
 + Likewise, I talked behind that, I don't know CLI, so I lost a lot of time for it. Maybe now, I can understand.
 + Firstly, talk about exercise 1. I don't have trouble with it. But my code is still awkward, How can I improve it?
 + Second, When you lead us do exercise, I hope you can give an detail example. I can base it to understand easily. Because, all matters you talk almost I didn't know before. Maybe I knew, but I can learn agian or understand other ways. 
 + Thirdly, I think I am really lucky when I am in your class. Because you are a professional dev, you have experience in job, you know what are improtant things for job and you teach them for us that I didn't learn from previous courses like Using git,.. 
 + Finally, I also lost more time for exercise 2. Because, some problems in it. For example, I can do exactly with URL of 24h.com.vn :)), but I think I can fix it in the future. Because I have to spend for other courses :)). 
- I hope I can learn more from you. That all my ideas. I will learn python:))
Thanks for reading.
